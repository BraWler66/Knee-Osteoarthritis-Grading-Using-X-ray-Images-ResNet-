# Knee Osteoarthritis Grading Using X-ray Images (ResNet)

This project applies deep learning to grade the severity of **Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)** using X-ray images. It uses a **pretrained ResNet50 model** as a feature extractor and classifies images into 5 grades (KL-0 to KL-4).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Digital Knee X-ray Images Dataset (from Kaggle)
- Includes expert-graded severity levels

## ðŸ“Š Grades:
- 0: Normal
- 1: Doubtful
- 2: Mild
- 3: Moderate
- 4: Severe

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Pretrained **ResNet50 (ImageNet)**
- GlobalAveragePooling â†’ Dense â†’ Dropout â†’ Softmax
- Transfer Learning + Fine Tuning

## ðŸ”§ Steps:
1. Load and preprocess images
2. Normalize and apply ResNet-specific preprocessing
3. Train/validation/test split with stratification
4. Train model using frozen base
5. Fine-tune and evaluate performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Accuracy: ~XX% (to be updated after training)
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Use EfficientNet for better accuracy
- Integrate Grad-CAM for explainability
- Build Gradio demo for deployment

## ðŸ§ª Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
